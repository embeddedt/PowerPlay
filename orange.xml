After the second round of voting, Mr. Yanukovych is declared the winner. One hundred Canadians and two parliamentary delegations observe the elections. However, there are widespread allegations of vote-rigging and fraud. Several international bodies, including the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, have decried the election and its results.</text>

		<text>International observers arrive in Ukraine. Over 1,000 Canadians are spread across the country, paired with observers from around the world. Observers investigate pre-election conditions: voting place staff, security of the ballot, privacy for voters, and the transparency of the process are all issues. The presence of observers is often enough to stop inappropriate activities, but still, the work can be dangerous.

Yanukovych's election tampering fails, thanks to a combination of election reforms and significantly increased number of election observers. Yushchenko takes the victory. </text>
